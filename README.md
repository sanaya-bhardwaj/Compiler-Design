The Compiler Design Project aims to create a compiler for a simple programming language. This project involves various stages of compiler construction, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The primary goal is to provide a hands-on understanding of compiler design principles and the challenges involved in translating high-level programming languages to machine code or intermediate representations.

## Features

**Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizing the input source code into meaningful symbols.

**Syntax Analysis:** Parsing the tokenized input to construct a syntax tree.

**Semantic Analysis:** Ensuring the syntactically correct source code adheres to semantic rules.

**Optimization:** Improving the intermediate code for better performance.

**Code Generation:** Translating the intermediate code into machine code or another intermediate language.

**Error Handling:** Providing meaningful error messages and recovery mechanisms during compilation.
