## CodeNex: Compiler Design Project 

The Compiler Design Project aims to create a compiler for a simple programming language. This project involves various stages of compiler construction, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The primary goal is to provide a hands-on understanding of compiler design principles and the challenges involved in translating high-level programming languages to machine code or intermediate representations.

## Features

**Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizing the input source code into meaningful symbols.

**Syntax Analysis:** Parsing the tokenized input to construct a syntax tree.

**Semantic Analysis:** Ensuring the syntactically correct source code adheres to semantic rules.

**Optimization:** Improving the intermediate code for better performance.

**Code Generation:** Translating the intermediate code into machine code or another intermediate language.

**Error Handling:** Providing meaningful error messages and recovery mechanisms during compilation.

Phases of a Compiler
1. Lexical Analysis
Objective:
Convert the source code into a sequence of tokens.
Identifies and categorizes tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
Tools:
Lexical Analyzer or Lexer generates tokens from the input source code.
Output:
Token stream.
2. Syntax Analysis
Objective:
Ensure the sequence of tokens conforms to the rules of the grammar for the programming language.
Constructs a parse tree or syntax tree representing the syntactic structure of the program.
Tools:
Parser verifies the syntactic correctness using a grammar.
Output:
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
3. Semantic Analysis
Objective:
Checks the meaning of statements and expressions beyond their syntax.
Ensures semantic rules defined by the language are adhered to (e.g., type checking).
Tasks:
Type checking, variable declaration checks, function call validations.
Output:
Annotated AST or Symbol Table.
4. Intermediate Code Generation
Objective:
Translates the source code or AST into an intermediate representation (IR).
Simplifies the process of optimization and code generation.
Output:
Intermediate Code (e.g., Three-address code, Quadruples, Abstract Machine Code).
5. Code Optimization
Objective:
Improves the intermediate code to produce a more efficient version.
Enhances program speed and reduces memory usage.
Tasks:
Constant folding, dead code elimination, loop optimization, register allocation.
Output:
Optimized Intermediate Code.
6. Code Generation
Objective:
Translates the optimized intermediate code into the target machine code or another intermediate language.
Outputs executable code specific to the target architecture.
Output:
Target Machine Code or Bytecode.
Example Flow
Lexical Analysis:

Input: Source code in a high-level language.
Output: Token stream (tokens identified and categorized).
Syntax Analysis:

Input: Token stream from Lexical Analysis.
Output: Syntax tree (represents the syntactic structure of the program).
Semantic Analysis:

Input: Syntax tree.
Output: Annotated syntax tree (checks semantic rules and validates meaning).
Intermediate Code Generation:

Input: Annotated syntax tree.
Output: Intermediate code (e.g., Three-address code).
Code Optimization:

Input: Intermediate code.
Output: Optimized intermediate code (improves efficiency).
Code Generation:

Input: Optimized intermediate code.
Output: Target machine code or bytecode (executable code).
Conclusion
Understanding the phases of a compiler is essential for building efficient and reliable software systems. Each phase contributes to translating high-level programming languages into executable machine code or other target formats, ensuring correct and optimized program execution.
